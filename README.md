# Tracker-Controller
An Arduino Pro Micro gamepad with mechanical keys. Inspired by the M8 tracker by Dirtywave; suitable for headless use as well as other trackers that uses the NES-style layout, like LSDJ.
Emmulates either joystick or keyboard commands.  Multiple alternate keymapping modes available, 
configured by holding a key during start up.   The Arduino Keyboard Library and joystick library are used and will have to be installed.

materials:
8x mechanical switches of your choice, Arduino Pro Micro, and 2x 12 pos sockets or pin headers

Layout is single sided and suitable for home etching.   Uses either smd sockets or thru-hole sockets/pins for mounting the arduino.
